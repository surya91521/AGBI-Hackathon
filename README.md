This is an Medical App which has two seperate interfaces for doctor and patient. <br />
It contains email login via firebase for both doctors and patients.  <br />
The databse used to store all the information is firestore.  <br />
The patient will be able to upload photo of their skin disease and will be able to know the chances of the disease being a cancer or allergy.  <br />
