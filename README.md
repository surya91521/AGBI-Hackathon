# AGBI-Hackathon 
This is a Medical App that has two separate interfaces for doctor and patient.
It contains email login via firebase for both doctors and patients.
The database used to store all the information is firestore.
The patient will be able to upload photos of their skin disease and will be able to know the chances of the disease being cancer or allergy.
The patients will also be able to see the nearby doctors based on the specialty of the doctor and also view their profiles.
The doctor's section has a forum where every doctor registered can upload posts containing images and descriptions and the other doctors
will also be able to comment on it encouraging discussion, so it's basically a discussion forum for doctors.
